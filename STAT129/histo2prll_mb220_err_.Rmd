### Question 1

I modified the pipeline:

```{r}
# time zgrep "TAVG" /stat129/*.gz | cut -d"," -f 4 | sort -n | uniq -c | awk '{print $1","$2}' > tAVG215mb.csv
# 
# 
# to
# 
# 
# time ls /stat129/*.gz | parallel 'zgrep "TAVG" {} | cut -d"," -f 4 | sort -n | uniq -c | awk "{print \$1\",\"$2}"' > tAVG215mb.csv
```



The idea was that ls would feed each file into the pipeline, handling each file as a chunk that would then be written into the csv file. However there is some sort of logic error I am still working out. Initially it was getting the awk command to work within the '', since that is typically its own notation. It required proper placement of \ to get it to make something reasonable. However the file output is still different that the original tAVG file, so more testing is necessary.

```{r}
hist_from_count = function(countfile, upper = 140, lower = -60, varname = "temperature (degrees F)", ...)
{
    # Plot a histogram of the temperature for our weather data.

    d = read.table(countfile, row.names = NULL, sep = ",")
    colnames(d) = c("count", "value")
    d[["count"]] = as.numeric(d[["count"]])

    # Convert from tenths of degree celsius to Fahrenheit
    d[["value"]] = (d[["value"]]/10 * (9/5)) + 32

    # Drop outliers
    d = d[lower < d[["value"]] & d[["value"]] < upper, ]

    # general logic for creating a histogram from output of bash table:
    #        sort | uniq --count > counts.txt
    result = hist(d[["value"]], plot = FALSE, ...)
    d[["bin"]] = cut(d[["value"]], breaks = result[["breaks"]])
    counts = tapply(d[["count"]], d[["bin"]], sum)
    counts[is.na(counts)] = 0

    result[["counts"]] = counts
    result[["density"]] = counts / sum(counts)
    result[["xname"]] = varname
    result
}


# Example if you've saved resulting table as temp_counts.txt
h = hist_from_count("C:\\Users\\mikeb\\Documents\\Stat129\\tAVG220Prll.csv")
plot(h)
```


After looking at the histogram though, it appears to take a similar shape as the original file, but shows a greater spread? Really not sure what the deal is. I also noticed that RMD is not showing the exact notation, taking out the slashes and hyphens, so I'll have to go back and probably turn it into r-code as a comment.




I did go back and turn it into R-code comments and that seems to preserve it better.

### Question 2

Despite the aforementioned, the parallel process was 3.8x faster than the non-parallel process. I'll include the time stamps below

***Original time***

***Time in parallel***
![time of prll pipeline](time2_prll1030_mb220.png)

that is about 2 mins and 30 seconds if you are having a hard time seeing that last picture.

### Question 3

This is part of why I initially thought the idea would work, since each core appears to be moving chunks through a pipeline. Though I only see three sort commands and three cut commands so not sure what the deal is there. I suppose it did work in some capacity, but I'm pretty sure the data I pulled is not quite right.


I'll add a closeup of the exouser processes as well as another cap from another run.
